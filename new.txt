Titanis is a genus of Phorusrhacidae, 
or "terror birds". The extinct family of 
large, predatory birds originated in South 
America and inhabited parts of the present-day 
United States during the Pliocene. Like all phorusrhacids, 
Titanis had elongated hind limbs, a thin pelvis, proportionally 
small wings, and a large skull with a hooked beak. Estimates placed Titanis 
at 1.4 to 2 meters (4.6 to 6.6 ft) in height and over 300 kilograms (660 lb) 
in body mass. Phorusrhacids are thought to have been ground predators or 
scavengers, apex predators that dominated Cenozoic South America. They may 
have swallowed small prey whole or targeted larger prey with repeated strikes 
of the beak. Titanis likely preyed on mammals such as the extinct armadillo 
relatives Holmesina and Glyptotherium, equids, tapirs, capybaras, and other 
Pliocene herbivores.
